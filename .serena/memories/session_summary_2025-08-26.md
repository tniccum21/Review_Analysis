# Session Summary - 2025-08-26

## Session Overview
Successfully loaded and analyzed the LangExtract project, which has been transformed from a library into a Review Analysis Dashboard application.

## Key Discoveries
1. **Corrected Key Files Identification**
   - Main apps are `streamlit_analyze_app.py` and `streamlit_dashboard_app.py` (not streamlit_review_app.py as initially thought)
   - `streamlit_analyze_app.py`: Processes reviews with LLM
   - `streamlit_dashboard_app.py`: Visualizes analysis results

2. **Project Architecture**
   - Modular design with UI layer (Streamlit) and processing layer (process_reviews.py)
   - Supports multiple LLM providers (local and cloud)
   - Batch processing with progress tracking
   - Rich analytics and visualization capabilities

3. **Development Environment**
   - Python project with Streamlit framework
   - Google-style code with 2-space indentation
   - Uses pylint for code quality
   - No formal test suite - relies on manual UI testing
   - macOS/Darwin system

4. **Data Flow**
   - CSV upload → Column mapping → LLM processing → Results export
   - Multiple analysis result files stored (analysis_results_*.csv)
   - Product metadata integration via products.csv

## Session Actions
1. Activated project with Serena MCP
2. Performed onboarding analysis
3. Created 6 memory files:
   - project_overview

   - code_style
   - suggested_commands
   - task_completion_checklist
   - design_patterns

## Important Context for Next Session
- Project ready for development work
- All dependencies in requirements.txt
- Main entry points: streamlit_analyze_app.py and streamlit_dashboard_app.py
- Sample data available in all_reviews.csv
- Multiple analysis result files available for testing dashboard
